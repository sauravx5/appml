**What?**
appML is an HTML extension specifically designed for web-based apps.

**WHAT?!?**
Yes! appML is an HTML extension: it defines new amazing tags for a rapid, clean, powerful and beautiful web app developing. appML tags are intuitive and ready-to-use and allow you to quickly develop your new great HTML-based app, only focusing on the creative part of the work and automatically having plenty of amazing features to enjoy!

**How?**
appML is a pure javascript+css library, and thus it has no external dependency, no software to install, nothing of nothing: simply download appML, link it in your HTML and start to use amazing tags like `<panel>, <page>, <scrollable>, <carousel>` and many others (have a look at features and documentation)!

**How much?**
appML costs nothing! It's completely open source and it's free to use, modify, merge and redistribute in your new great works (see the license for more details).
... Oh, of course if you want you can make a donation to help and sustain our work, so that we can add new cool features and extend appML's compatibility on several different platforms.

**Open source? YES!**
We strongly believe in open source development as the only way to build widespread, quality and looking-forward software. appML itself merge some of the most exciting libraries in the web for mobile applications development (David Kaneda's JQTouch, Matteo Spinelli's iScroll and the beautiful JQuery framework, thanks to all of the authors to have inspired and made possible appML!). It extends each of them, allowing for their contextual use and adding a lot of cool features and a clean developing model, to create a new powerful library that you can freely use and enjoy!

**Platforms?**
appML is still in Beta version. Right now, it's optimized for Safari Mobile browsers (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch devices) but thanks to its high-level architecture it will run on a large set of different platforms and browsers, following the "Progressive Enhancement" principle and maybe directly using jQuery mobile on several browsers (we are anxiously waiting for its final release... ;-)).
appML also runs on Safari and Google Chrome on desktop operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux), and you can enjoy it if you have a touch-enabled device (otherwise you can simulate your fingers with the mouse...). Try the demo: your Windows tablet will look like an iPad... ;-)
